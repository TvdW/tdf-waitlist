# Anchoring
Below you will find visual and written guidance on anchoring, bastion points and Micro Jump Drive points in the new meta, but please remember this is guidance only, different situations and events can and will change the course of your anchoring, bastion activation and MJD so it is by no means a be all and end all guide. Hopefully however it will help newer pilots to understand where and when to anchor, bastion & MJD. All guidance is subject to change too so check back as we continue to figure out the best way to keep our isk/h going up. **Remember, FC intructions overule any guidance!**

Note: All images are shown as a top down overview of each room/site with the tactical overlay enabled.

## TPPH First room

Bastions:
* Turn left, burn towards outgate (K1 & S1), bastion as soon as you reach top speed, should roughly be 1/3 through your burn (see x), this lets you drift towards outgate. Switch to conflag as paladin, Null for kronos unless all three battleships within Void range.

Vindi:
* You should pick a Romi or Osti and burn to within Void range (V1), web seperate targets and call your webs, "drive-by" shoot these targets but use common sense, if fleet is slow, stay and shoot it with void longer, if someone is already going for your target, pick one which doesnt have a vindi friend! Once your target reaches armor burn to outgate (V2)

Logi:
*  Turn left, burn to outgate (L1).

### TPPH Second room

Bastions:
* Start with Scorch/Null, burn towards outgate (K1 & S1), bastion as soon as you reach top speed (see x), drift towards outgate. Switch to conflag as Paladin once Sansha in range, Null for kronos entire room unless several targets in void range.

Vindi:
* Pick a Romi or Osti and burn to within Void range (V1), web seperate targets and call your webs, "drive-by" shoot these targets, if someone is already going for your target, pick a different one. Once target hits armor, burn to outgate (V2)

Logi:
* Burn to outgate (L1).

### TPPH Third Room

Bastions:
* Bastion one cycle as soon as you land on beacon (K1 & S1) use Scorch/Null "Its Tama Time!", once bastion cycle ends align to the left of tower and up, aim for roughly 20km each direction, as Kronos your aiming to jump right on-top of 2nd wave spawn (see pink MJD landing point) but you are burning 10km back (K2) to be in Void range for both wave spawns. As paladin you want to MJD roughly 10km from spawn (see yellow MJD landing point) so you land between the spawn and tower, Paladins should also burn back 10km (S2) to be in opti range with conflag of all wave spawns and tower. **Burning back here is VERY important for both bastion ships as it allows you to stay in bastion throughout both waves and be in opti range of high dps ammo.** Kronos should burn to the final anchor point (K3) once last wave is nearly dead, 

Vindi:
* Webs here are key to fast site times, you should pick a Romi or Osti and burn to within Void range (V1), web seperate targets and call your webs, "drive-by" shoot these targets, if someone is already going for your target, pick a different one. Anchoring for the next two waves is more important here so do not waste time and keep burning to your next Anchor (V2) you need to be in position before the wave spawns. Spread your webs, call them, and as the wave is dying slowboat to your next anchor point (V3), when the next wave spawns its the same process as the previous wave, spread webs, call them, slowboat anchor to your final point (V4) on the tower.

Logi:
*  Its important to get away from the beacon quickly here, use the gate sliding technique so you can get to your anchor L1 asap. With everyone in bastion on the beacon and most of the NPC's out of range, there is low damage from NPC's, however should a pilot make a mistake and MJD instead of bastion or burning and have the aggro you want to be burning into range as fast as possible. Make sure to elevate your anchor point so that you are inline with top of tower roughly.
