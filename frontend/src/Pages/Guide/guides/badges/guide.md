# Badges

## Uses

Badges are a tool mostly for FCs to quickly see what the fleet composition looks like and to check a pilots fitting meets requirements. Used to quickly verify information about a pilot without the need for every FC to know exactly what every pilot has on every toon they have in the whole game.

And some people like them.

To attain an implant badge, ask an FC (not the active one) to check your implants. For others, ask an FC and they will start the process of you getting it.
