# Upgrading

If you're low on ISK, you can start by getting the Megathron. If you do, it's important that you focus on upgrading to another ship as soon as possible. TDF works with a tier system. Pilots can be categorized as starter, basic, elite and elite gold.


## STARTER

1. Get a Nightmare or Vindicator

2. Armor compensation Skills lvl 4

3. __Tank and rig change to basic fit or better__ (do this upgrade all at once!)
All rigs and tank modules must be changed to match the basic fit These modules include:
	- Damage Control Units
	- Multispectrum Coatings
	- Burst Aerator Rigs
	- Resistance Rigs (Thermal, EM, Kinetic, Explosive)

3. Train starter-colored skills starting with warp drive operation, gunnery skills 

4. Train and get T2 guns and the remainder of the basic fit modules starting with Stabilizers/heat sinks

You are not longer starter and will be placed in a normal squad, congratulations!

## BASIC

1. Get the Elite fit (or advanced nightmare)
   & Train/inject elite level gunnery skills
3. Get the Hybrid implant set
   The recommended order for these is slot 10 first (6% extra damage), then slot 8 and 9 (another 6% DPS), then slot 7 (better tracking of targets), followed by slots 1-6. Once your set is complete you can upgrade to the _hybrid fit, which adds a lot of damage!
5. Train bastion requirements: 
   * Armor Compensations to 5
   * Mechanics and hull upgrades 5
   * Paladin/Kronos skills
   
    (Or go for elite vindicator, train remainder of the skills)
    
5. Transfer into a bastion Kronos or a Paladin

4. Train marauders 4

5. Train all remaining elite skills with priority based on what you want more, capacitor/speed/tracking etc





## ELITE
Now you are ELITE !

1. Train marauders 5
2. Train other skills to 5 that makes you apply more DPS like your gun specialization 5
3. Get some abyssals on [mutaplasmid.space](https://mutaplasmid.space/)
4. You can now get every skill on the skillchecker to **ELITE GOLD** level this tier is not required and now you can consider branching out to another ship. Maybe try logistics?
