# TDF rules

## General Rules

1. Assholes will be kicked, we only allow Diicks here.
2. Never harm the TDF community on purpose
3. Please don't be harsh, be sweet and kind to other pilots!

## TDF hierarchy

1. Council
2. FC Trainer / HQ / AS / VG / Probationary FCs
3. Trainee

## Invite policy

1. Any pilot who is able to meet basic tank requirements _and_ is able to fly a doctrine fit from one of the TDF FIT mailing lists should always be able to get into the fleet.
2. Any pilot below the "basic skills" counts as starter. If pilots are running more than 4 weeks without basic skills they get a 1 month ban to train all missing skills.
3. FCs should run fleets with no more than 4 starter pilots on grid, to ensure the fleet is ISK-effective.
4. 3 times disconnect from game & teamspeak -> no invite.
5. Any pilot that is not willing to participate in contest should not be invited.

## Pilot expectations

1. Meet the basic skill requirements within 1 month of flying.
2. Bring at least an Advanced fit and slots 7-10 implants within 2 months of flying
3. Bring at least an Elite fit within 3 months and Elite skills within 5 months of flying.
4. Pilots failing to meet the basic skills within 1 month, or advanced fit within 3 months or elite fit within 5 months get a 1 month ban to train all missing skills/buying the elite fit
5. Able to understand basic fleet commands in English. _Translators are not permitted._

4. Pilots who are repeat offenders, or who are disruptive in the TDF-WL channel due to their poor skills, should be banned from the TDF-WL channel for at most one day.
5. Pilots who repeatedly sandbag, or who are continually distracted in fleets, should be removed from the fleet for their own safety after fair warning.
6. Any kind of strong harassment in TS / discord or ingame (e.g. homophobic, racicist)
7. Refusal to take gates during a contest will result in a 24hr ban for first offence and may be escalated to council issuing a permaban for further offenses.
