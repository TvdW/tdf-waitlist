# Scouting guide

## Introduction

Fleet scouts are an essential part of an HQ Fleet! Scouts help the FC find available sites and make the fleet win contests. Intel is key! Scouts mark sites that are taken by other communities, notifies the FC about their activities and preload TCRC's. Being able to communicate directly with the FC in voice comms is prefered.

## Tools

[Site Timers](https://www.online-timers.com/multiple-timers)
[Fleet Dscan](https://dscan.info/)

## Dscanning

Press V to dscan and open the dscan window. Make sure the angle is set to 360Â°. The range can be asjusted Between 5 to 1 AU, sometimes there are sites within 5 AU and there can be false positives. Make sure to have filters that show only ships, wrecks and drones. Having them all togheter is doable but might make it harder, chose what works best for you.
Make sure to have a sites tab in your overview so you can see the incursion sites and see how far they are to manage your dscan range.

Once you master Dscanning you can start looking at wrecks and drones in order to monitor and notify the FC where other fleets are in their sites for possible contests ! Usually the active FC will ask you.

## Tagging

It is recommended to have shortcuts for X, sequential numbers, letters and A. 
Your objective is to mark sites with an X if they are taken by another fleet. Numbers can be used to differentiate several identical sites that are clear. If there are several communities up you can tag the other community with another letter like J.
Tag the site TDF is in A.

## Preloading

TCRC's have to be preloaded. In order to do this you just have to warp inside the site. From there you can either immediatly warp off or cloak. You might have to very quickly burn away from the beacon in order to be able to cloak.
If you just warped of your job is done, if not you can tag the site. X tag on auga and the 2 schmaels orbiting the romi on the left (not the group at the tower, the one just before that.)

## Site Timers

Once you master all the other aspects of scouting, you might also consider doing site timers. Incursions sites respawn after exactly 7 minutes. Your job would be to add a new timer using the linked tool every time a site goes down so that the fleet knows when a respawn happens. 
If you do and master all of the above you are a god-tier pilot and TDF thanks you. You make fleets run faster !
